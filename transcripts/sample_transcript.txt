[09:00 AM] John: Good morning everyone, and welcome to our weekly project meeting.
[09:01 AM] Mary: Good morning, John.
[09:01 AM] Alex: Morning all.
[09:02 AM] John: Today, we'll review updates on the new website development, discuss API integration issues, and plan our upcoming marketing campaign.
[09:03 AM] Mary: I'll start with the design updates. The design team finalized two layout options yesterday, and we now need to decide which one to move forward with.
[09:04 AM] John: Excellent, Mary. Please share those options with the group after the meeting.
[09:05 AM] Alex: On the technical side, we've completed the integration with the payment gateway, and it’s performing well in staging. However, we’re encountering intermittent issues with the shipping module's API.
[09:06 AM] John: Can you provide more details on the API issue, Alex?
[09:07 AM] Alex: Sure. The shipping API is returning inconsistent error messages and failing validation checks sporadically. We suspect that it’s an issue on the vendor's end.
[09:08 AM] Mary: I’ll contact the vendor support team today to get more clarity on the issue.
[09:09 AM] Tim: With these technical challenges, should we consider adjusting our project timeline or notify the client about potential delays?
[09:10 AM] John: That’s a good point, Tim. Alex, what’s your estimation for resolving these API issues?
[09:11 AM] Alex: I believe it will take about 2–3 days to resolve once we get prompt vendor assistance.
[09:12 AM] John: Alright, we’ll tentatively extend the shipping module deadline by 3 days.
[09:13 AM] Mary: I’ve updated the project timeline and sent out a revised version to everyone via email.
[09:14 AM] Tim: Thanks, Mary. That should help everyone adjust their schedules.
[09:15 AM] Sarah: Hi everyone, I have some updates from the marketing team. We’ve drafted a new social media campaign aimed at increasing engagement for the product launch.
[09:16 AM] John: Great to hear, Sarah. Could you highlight the key points of the campaign?
[09:17 AM] Sarah: Certainly. The campaign emphasizes the product's unique features through teaser posts, influencer collaborations, and interactive content. We aim to launch it next Monday.
[09:18 AM] John: That sounds promising. Do you have any metrics or targets set for the campaign?
[09:19 AM] Sarah: We’re targeting a 15% increase in engagement during the first week and will track performance via our analytics dashboard.
[09:20 AM] Alex: Are there any dependencies between the technical updates and the marketing launch that we need to address?
[09:21 AM] Sarah: There might be. We’ll coordinate closely with the tech team to ensure the website is stable before the campaign goes live.
[09:22 AM] John: Good. Moving on, does anyone have updates on QA or resource allocation?
[09:23 AM] Tim: Yes, I have an update on QA. We found a few critical bugs in the latest build, but most have been resolved. A few minor bugs remain, which we expect to fix by tomorrow.
[09:24 AM] Mary: Have those minor bugs been documented and assigned?
[09:25 AM] Tim: They have, and I’ve updated our issue tracker accordingly.
[09:26 AM] John: Excellent. Now, regarding resource allocation—Mary, I noticed that the testing team is a bit overwhelmed. Any thoughts on that?
[09:27 AM] Mary: I agree. It might be necessary to allocate additional resources temporarily to support the QA team.
[09:28 AM] Tim: I’ll reach out to HR to see if we can bring in some temporary contractors for QA.
[09:29 AM] Alex: That would be very helpful for the team.
[09:30 AM] John: Let’s also review our upcoming sprint tasks. Mary, can you provide a brief overview of the design tasks planned for next week?
[09:31 AM] Mary: Sure. Next week, the design team will refine the chosen layout option, create additional assets for the website, and prepare mockups for the mobile version.
[09:32 AM] Sarah: I’ll work with the social media team to ensure our promotional materials are in line with the new design.
[09:33 AM] John: Excellent teamwork. Alex, any additional technical updates?
[09:34 AM] Alex: Apart from the API issues, we are on track with feature development. I’ll continue to monitor the API and report any further discrepancies immediately.
[09:35 AM] Tim: I’ll update our project tracking board with the revised deadlines and resource changes once HR confirms additional support.
[09:36 AM] John: Perfect. Now, let’s outline our action items for today.
[09:37 AM] John: Action Items:
    - Mary to share the design options with the team and update the revised timeline.
    - Alex to work on resolving the shipping module API issue with vendor assistance, aiming for a resolution within 2–3 days.

[09:39 AM] Mary: I think that covers everything from my side.
[09:40 AM] Sarah: I’m good as well.
[09:41 AM] Alex: All clear.
[09:42 AM] Tim: No further questions.
